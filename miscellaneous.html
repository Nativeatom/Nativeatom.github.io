<h1> Miscellaneous</h1>
<p>
  I hold broad interests in languages, history, sports, music (mostly classical so far) and cooking. You're welcomed to share anything interesting with me!

<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>

  My mother tongue are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiang_Chinese">Xiang</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese"> Chinese Mandarin</a>, and I have also trying to develop skills in others. It is quite fun to swim and pick up shells in the ocean of pronuciation and tongues in languages (including dialects), the evolution and connections of vocabulary.

    I hold a certification in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_martial_arts">Chinese martial arts</a>, and also like swimming and soccer. I have participated online-marathon for 3 times.

      I have been a <em>puro Rossonero</em> (supporter of <a href="https://www.acmilan.com/en">Milan</a> in Lega Serie A, Italy) since 2006. It is a team with family atmosphere. I share commentaries about some of their stories, which inspired me when I was in the valley.

<h2>Classical Music</h2>
<p>
My favorite composers include Mozart, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, and Shostakovich. I am trying to develop my taste of other genres like Jazz (ragtime looks good).
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.andreabocelli.com/">Andrea Bocelli</a> is an excellent performer.
