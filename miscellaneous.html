<h1> Miscellaneous</h1>

<p>
  I hold broad interests in languages, history, sports classical music and cooking. You're welcomed to share anything interesting with me!

<h2>Languages</h2>

Mandarin is my mother tongue, and I have also learned English, some French, Japanese and Ancient Greek. The differnece between pronuciation and tongues in languages(including dialects), the evolution and connections of vocabularies are very charming.

Such evolution also makes me interested in history.

     I have been a fan of A.C. Milan (Lega Serie A, Italy) since 2006, it is a team with family atmosphere. It inspired me when I am down and I write some of their stories in the column.
